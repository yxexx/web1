 <h2>List of films</h2>
 <p><strong>1. Pulp Fiction</strong><br>Tarantino's eclectic crime masterpiece inspired an entire generation of imitators who could never live up to the quickfire dialogue of his captivatingly flawless screenplay.<br>The movie's story follows several intersecting plot threads of various underworld characters in Los Angeles around the same time and its playfulness in the face of incredibly dark scenarios, a mixed-up timeline, and disturbing violence made it an instant classic of modern cinema.</p>

 <p><strong>2. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</strong><br>Tarantino's latest movie proved to be one of his biggest successes with critics to date, earning Brad Pitt his first Oscar for his role as the director's famously-memorable supporting character show-stealer this time around.<br>As the title implies, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood gets misty-eyed for a bygone era of Hollywood in the 1960s but its surprising retelling of the tragic story of Sharon Tate comes off as both one of the director's most dreamlike and personal works so far.</p>

 <p><strong>3. Kill Bill Vol. 2</strong><br>Though not as arresting as the first installment, critics seem to agree that Kill Bill Vol. 2 was the superior half of the double-bill, utilizing a slower Western feel over the first part's more fast-paced Eastern martial arts style.<br>As The Bride closes in on her final target, the titular Bill, she finds her resolve tested by her mixed feelings for the assassin boss as well as a revelation about their history together.</p>

 <p><strong>4. Django Unchained</strong><br>A much more successful take on Westerns, race, and violence than The Hateful Eight, but no less provocative, Django Unchained follows Jamie Foxx's freed slave as he teams up with Christoph Waltz's bounty hunter to find his wife and free her also.<br>Waltz would again take home an Oscar for his performance, cementing his partnership with Tarantino as one of the most significant seen in movies of the 21st century so far whilst also providing unforgettable characters for his most well-known collaborator, Samuel L. Jackson, and superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>

 <p><strong>5. Reservoir Dogs</strong><br>Tarantino's breakthrough crime movie caused film fans and critics to instantly fall in love with his writing style and playful direction.<br>The fairly unforgiving story follows a group of criminals falling apart after a robbery gone wrong and the pitch-perfect cast established a number of Tarantino's most frequent collaborators with iconic characters.</p>

 <p><strong>6. Grindhouse</strong><br>A collaboration with fellow director Robert Rodrguez to create a movie double-bill that harkened back to the B movies of yesteryear, Grindhouse is made up of two segments.<br>Rodriguez's zombie movie Planet Terror was generally enjoyed for what it is but Tarantino's Death Proof remains one of the director's more divisive movies, often defying genre and conventional structure to produce a very unique horror movie experience about a killer stunt man.</p>

 <p><strong>7. Sin City</strong><br>While Tarantino is only credited as a special guest director, with the main bulk of directing credit going to frequent collaborator Robert Rodriguez and famous comic book writer Frank Miller, his influence can be quite clearly felt throughout the movie.<br>Adapted from several stories of Miller's comic series of the same name, Sin City was a pioneer in contemporary R-rated comic book movies and the movie's incredible cast in tandem with its striking look made it impossible for critics to ignore.</p>

 <p><strong>8. Inglourious Basterds</strong><br>Tarantino's take on the war movie created a definitively postmodern view of the genre for the contemporary era.<br>Mostly following Brad Pitt's character and his group of Nazi hunters, it was Christoph Waltz's Oscar-winning breakthrough role as the movie's biggest villain that ultimately stole the show.</p>

 <p><strong>9. Kill Bill Vol. 1</strong><br>The first part of Tarantino's revenge epic was a blast of hyper-stylized action from the drama-heavy director and it resonated with fans, coming to stand out in popular culture more than most of the director's movies.<br>Uma Thurman's Bride character became instantly iconic and the movie's ultraviolent action sequences captivated audiences in a much more unifying way than a lot of Tarantino's often-polarizing gore.</p>

 <p><strong>10. The Hateful Eight</strong><br>Partly a murder mystery, partly a Western and very theatrical throughout, The Hateful Eight is one of Tarantino's biggest movies despite being set mostly in one location.<br>After controversies surrounding Django Unchained had changed the public perception of Tarantino as a filmmaker, the director delivered one of his ugliest and most provocative movies ever with critics and audiences reacting with less enthusiasm to this and the lengthy running time.</p>
